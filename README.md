# This repository is used to provide a base code for PyTorch-based training framework. One can easily develop their own model on top of it.
1. Some dirty codes are still there without debugging. 
2. UNet-based denoising/segmentation examples are used demos based on two open-access datasets
   1. Denoising: **[AAPM LowDose CT Challenge dataset](https://www.aapm.org/grandchallenge/lowdosect/)**
   2. Segmentation: **[StructSeg segmentation dataset](https://structseg2019.grand-challenge.org/)**.
